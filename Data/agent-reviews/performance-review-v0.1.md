## What Worked

- Performance is clearly marked as paper simulation and sample-data preview.
- Paper-only and sample-data labels remain present in the latest office outputs.

## What Failed

- Rolling comparisons need more history before they become useful.
- Current observations are based on a limited sample preview and should not be promoted beyond paper research.

## Quality Assessment

Useful for local review and process improvement, but not sufficient for external claims or automated behavior changes.

## Risks Observed

- Small sample set can make routine movement look more meaningful than it is.
- Repeated daily output can create review fatigue if not digest-throttled.

## Compliance Concerns

- No active compliance failure detected in the latest office compliance report.
- All proposals must remain review-only until a human approves a separate change.

## Data Gaps

- Longer sample history
- Trend summaries across multiple paper runs
- More explicit reason buckets for review.

## Confidence Assessment

Medium confidence in latest-run math; low confidence in trend interpretation.

## False Positive Risks

- A sample-only improvement may look useful due to limited test depth.
- A clean draft may still need human tone review before public use.

## False Negative Risks

- A useful issue may remain hidden until more run history exists.
- A weak pattern may not appear in the current small sample set.

## Improvement Proposals

### PROP-PERF-001: Add rolling paper metrics

- proposalId: PROP-PERF-001
- sourceEntity: Performance Desk
- problemObserved: The dashboard shows current run metrics but limited rolling comparison.
- proposedChange: Add a rolling paper-only view using internal history summaries.
- expectedBenefit: Helps separate one run from trend behavior.
- riskOfChange: Trend views can invite overinterpretation with small samples.
- requiredValidation: Require sample-size warning and compliance review.
- recommendedPriority: medium
- priority: review_next_digest
- promotionPath: idea -> experiment -> paper test -> QA -> human review -> approved change
- humanReviewRequired: true
- autoApplyAllowed: false

## Recommended Experiments

- PROP-PERF-001: test as a paper-only experiment after human review.

## Next Run Focus

Collect routine observations, update latest summaries, and defer normal review items to the next biweekly digest.

## Human Questions

- Which proposal should be promoted into a paper-only experiment first?
- Should the next digest emphasize risk, content quality, or dashboard clarity?
